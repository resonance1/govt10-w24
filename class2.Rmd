# Variables

R can save information as a variable using the following syntax: *variable name <- value*

Let's create a variable named output, with the value of 13.

```{r}

```

Get the value of the variable *output* by typing the variable name

```{r}

```

We can input variable names into functions. Let's take the natural log of *output*

Note: There are many helpful lists of functions online: <https://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html>

```{r}

```

Let's change the value of *output* by overwriting it

```{r}

```

Now let's copy the variable *output* to a new variable called *output2*

```{r}

```

We can perform mathematical operations directly on variables

```{r}

```

## String (text) variables

We can also store text within variables by wrapping the text in double quotation marks (""). Let's create a new variable called output3 that contains the words "gov 10"

```{r}

```

We can't perform mathematical operations on text

```{r}

```

# Working with vectors

*Vectors* are one-dimensional arrays. You can think of them as a single column of values. We can manually create a vector using the *c()* function. With c(), we can concatenate objects into a single vector

Let's look at the schools with the largest undergraduate populations:

| School (state)                         | Fall 2015 undergraduate enrollment |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| University of Central Florida          | 54,513                             |
| Liberty University (VA)                | 49,863                             |
| Texas A&M University---College Station | 48,960                             |
| Ohio State University---Columbus       | 45,289                             |
| Florida International University       | 41,038                             |

First we will create a vector of enrollments.

```{r}
enrollments <- c()
```

Vectors can be combined. We will now create two different vectors. The first will contain enrollments from schools in Florida (named *florida*), while the other vector ( *other* ) will contain enrollments from other schools. Using c() with the vector names, we can concatenate both of these vectors into a new vector named *all.schools*

```{r}

```

We can do this faster by using *indexing*, using the syntax variable_name[index]. Note: the first element in a vector is element 1, the second is element 2, etc.

```{r}

```

We can also run functions on vectors:

```{r}

```

# Data frames

Data frames are similar to a spreadsheet, and contain multiple observations (rows) and variables (columns). We'll also call them "data sets"

## Loading data frames

For this class, all data are stored in .csv format. Let's load enrollments.csv. There are three ways we can do this.

A)  Sync git, then read in the file:

```{r}
enrollments <- read.csv("data/enrollments.csv")
```

B) Download the .zip file and place all contents within your current working directory.

```{r}
enrollments <- read.csv("enrollments.csv")
```

C)  Download the file from the internet into your current directory:

```{r}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resonance1/govt10-w23/main/Class%20Sessions/enrollments.csv" ,"./enrollments.csv")
enrollments <- read.csv("enrollments.csv")
```

We can see the variable names in our data frame using *names()*

```{r}

```

We can select columns (vectors) in a dataframe by name using the *\$* operator. When using the *\$* operator we place the name of the data frame to the left and the name of the variable to the right.

Let's pull out a vector for the variable *enrollment*

```{r}

```

To create a new column in our data frame, we can also use the *\$* operator. If we pass it a single value, that value will be placed within every row.

```{r}

```

We can also create variables that are combinations of existing variables in the dataset:

```{r}

```



## Group work

Let's assume that class sizes (freshmen, sophomores, etc) are equal. Create a new variable in the dataset containing the size of the freshman class at each school.

```{r}

```

Since we are talking about people, we should not use decimals. Update the code above to use the *floor()* function to round down your answer to the nearest integer. Overwrite the variable you previously created.

```{r}

```

Using the new variable, calculate the average size of the freshman class within the entire dataset.

```{r}

```

# If time remaining: practice with Swirl

Run the following. Note: you must be connected to the internet

```{r}
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
install_course_github("kosukeimai","qss-swirl")
```

Then, in the console (bottom left window), type: swirl() and hit enter. Follow the prompts, and select the course 'qss-swirl'. Then choose Selection 1 (Intro 1). Continue until you get to \~80% completion. Note that the results will not be saved in the notebook - this is just an opportunity to practice. 

*Remember to type bye() in the console to leave Swirl!*

If you still have time remaining, you can also begin your problem set.

To submit your notebook, Knit to PDF. You do not need to run the tinytex code again to do so.


## Check-in

1.  On a scale ranging between 1 (Too Hard) and 10 (Too Easy), how was today's class:
2.  What was the easiest thing to understand?
3.  What was the most difficult thing to understand?
