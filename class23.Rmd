# t and p (Gulliver)

sample mean = 48
hypothesized mean = 6
sample standard deviation = 6
sample size = 10

First, let's calculate the t manually

```{r}

se <- 
  
```

Second, let's construct a 95% confidence interval

```{r}

```

And now, let's grab the p value

```{r}
pt(t, df=n-1, lower.tail=FALSE)*2

```


## A data example

Re-evaluate the Kenyan savings experiments.

```{r}
kenya <- read.csv("./class_data/rosca2.csv")
#download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resonance1/govt10-w24/main/class_data/rosca2.csv","rosca2.csv")
#kenya <- read.csv("rosca2.csv")
kenya <- subset(kenya,has_followup2 == 1)
```

Variables:

fol2_amtinvest  Amount invested in Kenyan shillings, in Wave 2 (outcome)
encouragement   Binary variable indicating whether individuals are in the control group (1) or not (0)
safe_box        Binary variable indicating whether individuals are in the safe deposit box treatment group (1) or not (0)
locked_box       Binary variable indicating whether individuals are in the locked box treatment group (1) or not (0)
bg_b1_age       age of participant
bg_female       gender of participant
bg_married     marital status of participant

Calculate the t-statistic and p-value (at the 95% level) for the null hypothesis that the difference between the locked box group and the control group is 0. Repeat for the safe box group. What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means?
 
```{r}

```

Now evaluate the randomization between the treated and control conditions with respect to age, gender, and marital status, at the 95% confidence level. Note: since there are two treatment conditions, you will have to evaluate the balance of each treatment relative to control.

```{r}

lb <- kenya %>% filter(safe_box!=1)
sb <- kenya %>% filter(locked_box!=1)


```

Can we conclude that the ATE is causal?
