# Filtering, continued

Load the data

```{r}
resume <- read.csv("./class_data/resume.csv")

#download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resonance1/govt10-w24/main/class_data/resume.csv","resume.csv")
#resume <- read.csv("resume.csv")

```

Select all resumes flagged as white females, and calculate the average callback rate

```{r}

```

Select all resumes flagged as white OR female, and calculate the average callback rate

```{r}

```

Now let's get the average callback rate of everyone else (who is not white or female)

```{r}

```


## Group Exercise

1. Using tidyverse functions, compare callback rates between black females and white females. Hint: try chaining together %>% filter() %>% group_by %>% summarize()

```{r}

```

2. Using tidyverse functions, compare callback rates between black males and white males. 

```{r}

```

3. Using tidyverse functions, compare callback rates between black males and all others. 

```{r}

```

4. Using tidyverse functions, compare callback rates between white females and all others.

```{r}

```


# Brief Lecture: Causality / Randomization 

# Simulating the effects of randomization (demonstration only - you do *not* need to know this code)

Initialize

```{r}
nrows <- 10000
age <- round(rnorm(10000,mean=40,sd=10))
college <- rbinom(10000,1,.38)
hair <- c(rep("brown",4000),rep("blonde",1000),rep("red",250),rep("black",4750))
handshake10k <- data.frame(age,college,hair)
```

Randomize

```{r}
handshake10k$treatment <- 0
randomsample <- sample(1:nrow(handshake10k),5000)
handshake10k$treatment[randomsample] <- 1
```

Let's check how accurate randomization was. Compare the mean value of age and college between the groups:

```{r}


```

Compare hair colors

```{r}

```

Visualize Law of Large Numbers via flipping a fair coin

```{r}
n <- 50000
x <- sample(0:1,n, repl=T)
s <- cumsum(x)
r <- s/(1:n)
plot(r, ylim=c(0, 1), type="l")
lines(c(0,n), c(.50,.50),col="red")
round(cbind(x,s,r), 5)[1:10,]; r[n]
```


# Group work

A) Practice: racial discrimination experiment

1. If the resume study was randomized correctly, each type of resume (black or white) should be the same, on average, with respect to other characteristics. Evaluate whether there is a similar proportion of female names in each type of resume (since sex is not a binary variable in this data, you need to use prop.table() to calculate this). What does this suggest about the quality of the randomization?

```{r}


```

B) Practice: health savings experiment

To understand why the poor are constrained in their ability to save for investments in preventative health products, researchers designed a field experiment in rural Kenya in which they randomly varied access to innovative saving technologies.  In the first treatment group (*Safe Box*), respondents were given a box locked with a padlock. This treatment is designed to estimate the effect of having a safe and designated storage technology for preventative health savings.  

In the second treatment group (*Locked Box*), respondents were given a locked box, but not the key to the padlock. The respondents were instructed to call the program officer once they had reached their saving goal, and the program officer would then meet the participant and open the box. Compared to the safe box, the locked box offered stronger commitment through earmarking (the money saved could only be used for health expenses). 

In this exercise, our outcome of interest is the amount (in Kenyan shilling) spent on preventative health products after 12 months.

## Load the data

```{r}
hsavings <- read.csv("./class_data/rosca.csv")

#download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resonance1/govt10-w24/main/class_data/rosca.csv","rosca.csv")
#hsavings <- read.csv("rosca.csv")

```

1. Evaluate the quality of the randomization. To do so, test whether participants in each of the three groups (safe_box, locked_box, or control) have a similar age, on average. Then check whether a similar proportion of the three groups are female, and finally whether a siilar proportion are married. 

```{r}


```

[Discuss randomization quality here]

2. Now calculate the average treatment effect for those assigned to the safe_box and locked_box conditions. Which was more effective in increasing health savings, relative to the control group?

```{r}



```

_Only if you have time_

3. Was the locked box treatment more effective among male or female study participants? Recalculate the average treatment effects for each subset of participants

```{r}

```

You can work on the problem set if you have additional time
